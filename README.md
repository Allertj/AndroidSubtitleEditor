Edit, style and sync your .srt or .sub subtitle files.

Start to easily edit your subtitles! This app comes with an internal player, in which you only have to place the first and last subtitles correctly to sync them to the video. It can load the subtitles and the video across LAN-Shares, so copying them to your local device is not necessary.

Deletion can be done with swiping, styling is made easy with different colors, but more advanced options are also available: Easily converting to a different frame rate, syncing to another subtitle, switching to a different charset and searching are made easy as well.

At any moment during editing, the current progress can be viewed under the video, so small corrections can be implemented directly!
